## 📋 FEATURE 6: Simplified Lock Inventory UI ✅

### What Changed
- **Removed** individual edit/delete buttons from lock table rows
- **Added** "Set Total Storage" button in header (replaced "Add Lock")
- **Created** modal dialog for setting total number of locks
- **Implemented** auto-generation of new locks (KEY-001, KEY-002, etc.)
- **Implemented** auto-deletion of unused locks when reducing total

### Files Modified
- `src/pages/Storage.js`

### Key Functions
```javascript
handleSetTotalStorage()
- Validates input (no negative, can't reduce below in-use count)
- Adds locks automatically with sequential key numbers
- Removes only unused locks when reducing
- Shows toast notifications for all operations
```

### User Experience
1. Click "Set Total Storage" button (blue, with Settings icon)
2. Modal shows current stats: X locks (Y in use)
3. Enter new total number
4. Preview shows what will change
5. Click "Update Storage"
6. Toast confirms action
7. Table refreshes automatically

### Validation
- ✅ Cannot set negative total
- ✅ Cannot reduce below currently in-use count
- ✅ Shows helpful error messages
- ✅ Auto-generates keys in format KEY-001, KEY-002, etc.
- ✅ Only removes unused locks

---

## 📋 FEATURE 7: Advanced Filters - View by Lock ✅

### What Changed
- **Added 4 new filters** to the existing zone filter
- **Responsive grid layout** (6 columns on desktop, adapts for mobile)
- **Auto-populated dropdowns** from existing data

### Files Modified
- `src/pages/ViewByLocks.js`

### New Filters
1. **Location** - Filter by breaker location
2. **State** - Filter by On/Off/Closed status
3. **General Breaker** - Filter by parent breaker
4. **Key Number** - Filter by specific lock key

### Filter Layout
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Search Bar (2 cols)] [Zone] [Location] [State] [Gen] [Key]    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile (1 col):** All filters stack vertically
- **Tablet (2 cols):** Search takes 2, filters take 1 each
- **Laptop (3 cols):** Search takes 3, filters share space
- **Desktop (6 cols):** Search takes 2, each filter takes 1

### Filter Logic
All filters work together (AND logic):
```javascript
matchesZone AND 
matchesLocation AND 
matchesState AND 
matchesGeneralBreaker AND 
matchesKeyNumber AND 
matchesSearch
```

## 📋 FEATURE 8: Company Logo & Force Sync Button ✅

### Part A: Company Logo

#### What Changed
- Added logo badge next to "Made by Hatim RG" in sidebar footer
- Gradient blue badge with "H" initial
- Enhanced text styling

#### Visual Design
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│  [H]  Made by Hatim RG │
│  ↑        ↑            │
│ Logo    Enhanced text  │
└────────────────────────┘
```

#### Implementation
```jsx
<div className="w-6 h-6 bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-500 to-blue-700 rounded flex items-center justify-center text-white text-xs font-bold">
  H
</div>
```

**Note:** To use a custom logo image, replace the badge `<div>` with:
```jsx
<img src="/company-logo.png" alt="Company Logo" className="w-6 h-6" />
```

### Part B: Force Sync Button

#### What Changed
- Added blue "Force Sync" button in header (before online status)
- Spinning icon during sync
- Toast notifications for progress and results
- Available to both Editor and Visitor modes

#### Features
- ✅ **Button States**:
  - Normal: "Force Sync" with RefreshCw icon
  - During sync: "Syncing..." with spinning icon
  - Disabled during operation
- ✅ **Toast Sequence**:
  1. Info toast: "Starting data sync..."
  2. Success toast: "Sync complete! 3 data types synchronized"
  3. Error toast: "Sync failed: [error message]" (if error)

#### Sync Logic
Currently implements:
1. Shows info toast
2. Simulates sync delay (1.5s)
3. Checks all data types (breakers, locks, personnel)
4. Shows success count
5. Shows final result toast

**For Production:** Implement actual Supabase sync logic in `handleForceSync()` function.

#### Header Layout (After)
```
[Force Sync] [Online/Offline] [User Badge] [Logout]
   (blue)       (green/red)      (blue/gray)   (red)
```
