# 🔒 LOTO KMS — Lock Sync with Breaker State

**Date:** October 31, 2025, 12:23 PM  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Locks Now Sync with Locked Breakers

---

## 🎯 Critical Update

**Previous Logic:**
- Lock marked as "used" if breaker has `lock_key` assigned
- Didn't consider breaker state (On/Off/Closed)
- Result: Locks shown as "in use" even when breakers are ON or OFF

**New Logic:**
- Lock marked as "used" ONLY if breaker has `lock_key` AND state is **"Closed"** (locked)
- Locks automatically released when breaker state changes from Closed → On/Off
- Result: "Locks in Use" = Number of actually LOCKED breakers

---

## 🔄 Updated Logic Flow

### Before:
```
Breaker R12:
  lock_key: "KEY-001"
  state: "On"  ← Breaker is ON (not locked)
    ↓
Lock KEY-001: used = 1  ❌ WRONG - Lock shown as "in use"
```

### After:
```
Breaker R12:
  lock_key: "KEY-001"
  state: "On"  ← Breaker is ON (not locked)
    ↓
Lock KEY-001: used = 0  ✅ CORRECT - Lock is available

Breaker R15:
  lock_key: "KEY-005"
  state: "Closed"  ← Breaker is LOCKED
    ↓
Lock KEY-005: used = 1  ✅ CORRECT - Lock is in use
```

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. `syncLockUsage()` - Core Sync Function

**Updated:** Only marks locks as used for **Closed** (locked) breakers

```javascript
// Step 2: Mark locks as used ONLY for breakers that are LOCKED (state = Closed)
let updatedCount = 0;
for (const breaker of breakers) {
  // Only mark lock as used if breaker has a lock AND is in Closed (locked) state
  if (breaker.lock_key && breaker.state === 'Closed') {
    const lock = locks.find(l => l.key_number === breaker.lock_key);
    if (lock) {
      // Mark lock as used
      await this.run(
        'UPDATE locks SET used = 1, assigned_to = ? WHERE key_number = ?',
        [breaker.name, breaker.lock_key]
      );
      updatedCount++;
      console.log(`✓ Lock ${breaker.lock_key} in use by LOCKED breaker ${breaker.name}`);
    }
  } else if (breaker.lock_key && breaker.state !== 'Closed') {
    console.log(`ℹ️ Lock ${breaker.lock_key} assigned to breaker ${breaker.name} but breaker is ${breaker.state} (not locked)`);
  }
}
```

**Console Output Example:**
```
🔄 Starting lock usage sync...
📦 Found 10 locks and 5 breakers
✓ All locks marked as available
✓ Lock KEY-001 in use by LOCKED breaker R12
ℹ️ Lock KEY-002 assigned to breaker R15 but breaker is On (not locked)
✓ Lock KEY-003 in use by LOCKED breaker R22
✅ Sync complete: 2 locks marked as in use
```

---

### 2. `addBreaker()` - Adding New Breaker

**Updated:** Only marks lock as used if new breaker is **Closed**

```javascript
// Mark lock as used ONLY if lock_key is provided AND breaker is Closed (locked)
if (result.success && breaker.lock_key && breaker.state === 'Closed') {
  await this.updateLockUsageByKey(breaker.lock_key, true, breaker.name);
  console.log(`🔒 Lock ${breaker.lock_key} marked as in use by new breaker ${breaker.name}`);
}
```

**Example:**
```
Add Breaker R25:
  lock_key: "KEY-007"
  state: "Off"
    ↓
Lock KEY-007: remains available (used = 0)
Console: (no lock usage update)

Add Breaker R26:
  lock_key: "KEY-008"
  state: "Closed"
    ↓
Lock KEY-008: marked as used (used = 1)
Console: 🔒 Lock KEY-008 marked as in use by new breaker R26
```

---

### 3. `updateBreaker()` - Updating Breaker

**Updated:** Handles all state transitions properly

```javascript
// Update lock usage status based on lock_key AND state changes
if (result.success) {
  // Determine if old breaker had lock in use (had lock_key AND was Closed)
  const oldLockInUse = oldBreaker?.lock_key && oldBreaker.state === 'Closed';
  
  // Determine if new breaker has lock in use (has lock_key AND is Closed)
  const newLockInUse = breaker.lock_key && breaker.state === 'Closed';
  
  // Release old lock if:
  // 1. Lock key changed, OR
  // 2. State changed from Closed to something else
  if (oldBreaker?.lock_key && 
      (oldBreaker.lock_key !== breaker.lock_key || (oldLockInUse && !newLockInUse))) {
    await this.updateLockUsageByKey(oldBreaker.lock_key, false);
    console.log(`🔓 Lock ${oldBreaker.lock_key} released from breaker ${breaker.name}`);
  }
  
  // Mark new lock as used ONLY if breaker is Closed (locked)
  if (breaker.lock_key && breaker.state === 'Closed') {
    await this.updateLockUsageByKey(breaker.lock_key, true, breaker.name);
    console.log(`🔒 Lock ${breaker.lock_key} marked as in use by breaker ${breaker.name}`);
  }
}
```

**Scenarios Handled:**

#### Scenario A: Lock Breaker (State: Off → Closed)
```
Before: R12 { lock_key: "KEY-001", state: "Off" }
After:  R12 { lock_key: "KEY-001", state: "Closed" }
    ↓
Console: 🔒 Lock KEY-001 marked as in use by breaker R12
Lock KEY-001: used = 1
```

#### Scenario B: Unlock Breaker (State: Closed → On)
```
Before: R12 { lock_key: "KEY-001", state: "Closed" }
After:  R12 { lock_key: "KEY-001", state: "On" }
    ↓
Console: 🔓 Lock KEY-001 released from breaker R12
Lock KEY-001: used = 0
```

#### Scenario C: Change Lock (Different lock_key)
```
Before: R12 { lock_key: "KEY-001", state: "Closed" }
After:  R12 { lock_key: "KEY-002", state: "Closed" }
    ↓
Console: 🔓 Lock KEY-001 released from breaker R12
Console: 🔒 Lock KEY-002 marked as in use by breaker R12
Lock KEY-001: used = 0
Lock KEY-002: used = 1
```

#### Scenario D: Remove Lock
```
Before: R12 { lock_key: "KEY-001", state: "Closed" }
After:  R12 { lock_key: null, state: "Closed" }
    ↓
Console: 🔓 Lock KEY-001 released from breaker R12
Lock KEY-001: used = 0
```

### 4. `deleteBreaker()` - Deleting Breaker

**Updated:** Only releases lock if breaker was **locked**

```javascript
async deleteBreaker(id) {
  // Get breaker data before deleting
  let breakerName = `Breaker #${id}`;
  let lockKey = null;
  let wasLocked = false;
  
  const breakers = await this.getBreakers();
  const breaker = breakers.data.find(b => b.id === id);
  if (breaker) {
    breakerName = breaker.name;
    lockKey = breaker.lock_key;
    wasLocked = breaker.state === 'Closed';
  }

  // Release the lock before deleting the breaker (only if it was actually locked)
  if (lockKey && wasLocked) {
    await this.updateLockUsageByKey(lockKey, false);
    console.log(`🔓 Lock ${lockKey} released from deleted breaker ${breakerName}`);
  }
  
  // ... delete breaker ...
}
```

**Example:**
```
Delete Breaker R12 (state: "Closed", lock_key: "KEY-001")
    ↓
Console: 🔓 Lock KEY-001 released from deleted breaker R12
Lock KEY-001: used = 0

Delete Breaker R15 (state: "On", lock_key: "KEY-002")
    ↓
Console: (no lock release - wasn't locked)
Lock KEY-002: remains as-is
```

## 📊 Real-World Example

### Scenario: Factory Floor with 5 Breakers

**Initial State:**
```
Breakers:
  R01: lock_key="KEY-001", state="On"     ← Has lock but NOT locked
  R02: lock_key="KEY-002", state="Closed" ← Has lock and IS locked
  R03: lock_key="KEY-003", state="Off"    ← Has lock but NOT locked
  R04: lock_key="KEY-004", state="Closed" ← Has lock and IS locked
  R05: lock_key=null,      state="On"     ← No lock assigned

Locks Status After Sync:
  KEY-001: used=0 (available) ← R01 is not locked
  KEY-002: used=1 (in use)    ← R02 is locked ✅
  KEY-003: used=0 (available) ← R03 is not locked
  KEY-004: used=1 (in use)    ← R04 is locked ✅

Storage Page: "Locks in Use: 2"  ✅ CORRECT
Dashboard: "Used Locks: 2"       ✅ CORRECT
```

**User locks R01:**
```
Update R01: state="Closed"
    ↓
Console: 🔒 Lock KEY-001 marked as in use by breaker R01
    ↓
KEY-001: used=1

Storage Page: "Locks in Use: 3"  ✅ Updated in real-time
Dashboard: "Used Locks: 3"       ✅ Updated in real-time
```

**User unlocks R02:**
```
Update R02: state="On"
    ↓
Console: 🔓 Lock KEY-002 released from breaker R02
    ↓
KEY-002: used=0

Storage Page: "Locks in Use: 2"  ✅ Updated in real-time
Dashboard: "Used Locks: 2"       ✅ Updated in real-time
```

## ✅ What This Fixes

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Lock Count** | Includes locks on ON/OFF breakers | Only counts locks on CLOSED breakers |
| **Accuracy** | "Locks in Use: 10" (all assigned) | "Locks in Use: 3" (only locked) |
| **Semantics** | "In Use" = "Assigned" | "In Use" = "Actually Locking" |
| **State Changes** | Lock status doesn't update | Lock released when unlocking breaker |
| **Data Integrity** | Breaker state ≠ Lock status | Breaker state = Lock status |

---

## 📊 Files Modified

| File | Changes | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `src/utils/database.js` | ~40 lines | Updated 4 functions with state checks |

**Functions Updated:**
1. ✅ `syncLockUsage()` - Only sync locked breakers
2. ✅ `addBreaker()` - Check state when adding
3. ✅ `updateBreaker()` - Handle state transitions
4. ✅ `deleteBreaker()` - Check state before release

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test 1: Basic Sync
1. Open console (F12)
2. Go to Storage page
3. Look for: `ℹ️ Lock XXX assigned to breaker YYY but breaker is On (not locked)`
4. Verify: Only CLOSED breakers' locks counted

### Test 2: Lock a Breaker
1. Go to View By Breakers
2. Find breaker with state "On" or "Off" that has a lock
3. Change state to "Closed"
4. Console: `🔒 Lock XXX marked as in use`
5. Storage: "Locks in Use" increases by 1

### Test 3: Unlock a Breaker
1. Go to View By Breakers
2. Find breaker with state "Closed" that has a lock
3. Change state to "On"
4. Console: `🔓 Lock XXX released`
5. Storage: "Locks in Use" decreases by 1

### Test 4: Compare Counts
1. Go to View By Breakers
2. Count breakers with state="Closed" that have lock_key
3. Go to Storage page
4. "Locks in Use" should equal that count

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Before Update:
```
Breakers with locks (any state): 10
Locks in Use display: 10
❌ Incorrect - includes non-locked breakers
```

### After Update:
```
Breakers with state="Closed" and lock_key: 3
Locks in Use display: 3
✅ Correct - only locked breakers
```
